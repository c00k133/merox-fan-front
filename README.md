# Fan Front - Base

This is a base [CadQuery](https://github.com/dcowden/cadquery) script for teaching myself the basics of CAD software.
I believed that starting with something that I am comfortable with might assist me in my learning process, i.e. CAD scripting in a language I am comfortable with (Python).

This script creates a base for the front panel of a [Merox Premium (40cm) fan](https://www.k-rauta.fi/rautakauppa/lattiatuuletin-merox-premium-40cm-valkoinen-alumiini).
I bought one of these on sale during the extremely hot summer of 2018.
When I put it together, I realized that I did not like the small circular front panel that came with the fan.
So I decided that I would try to make my own!

As of writing this I have unfortunately not tried to 3D-print the base yet.
I do have a need for the fan atm, so it is collecting dust in my storage unit.
I will 3D-print and assemble it once I either have extra time on my hand, or summer comes around again.

I measured the dimensions of the fan base by hand, you can find the measurements in the JSON file `dims.json`.
The naming should be self-explanatory.

If you simply want to know how the CAD object looks like, I added a GIF of object on a turntable below:
